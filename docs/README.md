Welcome to the Python Template created via a cookiecutter recipe. The project template is designed for a development via a `Double Loop approach` (BDD-TDD) using pytest and several other pytest libs.

## Description

There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!

Note:
Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

## Domain

Also get your score 
Get the average overall and let the user know if they are better than the average.
